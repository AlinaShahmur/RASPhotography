### Web-site porftolio for photographer
The main goal of Web-site porftolio photographer is to provide the way to land more clients. It helps the potential clients to make decision whether the photographer meets their expectations.
The clients can see the portfolio of photographer: photos and virtuals tours, and they can send him email if they are ready to collaborate with him.

Techologies used in the project: 
1. HTML5, CSS3, JS
2. PHP 5.5 
3. gulp 4.0.2
4. SASS 1.32.8

I used PHP for creating sendmail feature. 
Gulp helped me to automate workflow and optimize project(js-minifier, css-minifier)
SASS allowed me to write more structured an optimized css-code.


The web-site is on the hoisting now, URL: http://rasphoto.co.il/
